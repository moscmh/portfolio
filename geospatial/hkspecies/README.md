# Hong Kong Species Prediction API
Interactive web application through **AWS Lightsail** for exploring Hong Kong's biodiversity with 2025 species occurrence predictions estimated by a Convolutional Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) `deep learning` model.

## Features
- **Species Search & Exploration** - Browse 1000+ Hong Kong species
- **Interactive Maps** - Visualise species occurrences with `Leaflet` maps
- **AI Predictions** - `CNN-LSTM` predictions for 2025 species locations
- **Real-time Data** - Species occurrence data from 2001-2024
- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Production Deployment (AWS Lightsail)
- AWS CLI configured
- AWS Lightsail access

## Data Preprocessing
- The Hongkong map was divided into 20x20 grids for simplification.
- The *target* variable (location) was the grid ID.
- Each species has its own array with shape, (24, 20, 20), storing number of occurrences in each year.

## Deep Learning Model
- **CNN-LSTM** ([ndrplz](https://github.com/ndrplz/ConvLSTM_pytorch))
- **Training**: Adam optimizer, BCE loss, 100 epochs with early stopping.
- Output example (Predictions: Shades of red; Actual occurrences: blue squares):
