# Projects Description
## [Medical Cost Prediction](https://ega9jfdpus338or2uiuqx8.streamlit.app/)
&emsp;The [dataset](https://github.com/stedy/Machine-Learning-with-R-datasets/blob/master/insurance.csv) contains `1338` individuals' information with `6` attributes. They are `age`, `sex`, `BMI`, `number of children`, `whether is a smoker`, `residential region`. The outcome variable is the medical cost. This project showed a promising predictive **linear regression** model for estimating medical cost. It can be useful for insurance companies and government to determine policy cost and to allocate resources respectively. 

&emsp;Eventually, after conducting **exploratory data analysis** and **feature engineering**, a new feature was created that may be related to `hospital choice`. Together with `age` and `whether is a smoker`, a regression model with approximately 96.6% accuracy was built.

## [Perth Fuel Forecast](https://moscmh-portfolio-time-seriesperth-fuel-forecastapp-0rwtuw.streamlit.app)
&emsp;The project follows `Box-Jenkins`'s modelling framework that consists of `identification`, `estimation`, `model diagnostic`, and `production` to practise analysing and making forecast of a time series dataset, Perth's fuel prices. Note that the fuel price is expressed as cents per litre (AUD/100L). Data was collected from [Fuel Watch](https://www.fuelwatch.wa.gov.au).
