# Projects Description
## Medical Cost Prediction
&emsp;The [dataset](https://github.com/stedy/Machine-Learning-with-R-datasets/blob/master/insurance.csv) contains `1338` individuals' information with `6` attributes. They are `age`, `sex`, `BMI`, `number of children`, `whether is a smoker`, `residential region`. The outcome variable is the medical cost. This project showed a promising predictive **linear regression** model for estimating medical cost. It can be useful for insurance companies and government to determine policy cost and to allocate resources respectively. 

&emsp;Eventually, after conducting **exploratory data analysis** and **feature engineering**, a new feature was created that may be related to `hospital choice`. Together with `age` and `whether is a smoker`, a regression model with approximately 96.6% accuracy was built.
