# Perth Fuel Price Forecast
&emsp;The project follows `Box-Jenkins`'s modelling framework that consists of `identification`, `estimation`, `model diagnostic`, and `production` to practise analysing and making forecast of a time series dataset, Perth's fuel prices. Note that the fuel price is expressed as cents per litre (AUD/100L).  

&emsp;According to the forecast, the average fuel price in Perth metro area will fluctuate around `AUD$177/100L` in the coming two years. The forecast does not reproduce the spikes as happened in the past. To improve, more data from the past is recommended to determine if there is a pattern and/or a trend in the time series.
